before broccoli:

abstract for emberconf
scotlandjs

ask if emberconf abstract is ok



before beta:

- tmp dir handling
  - what's a good api for this?
  - depends on how we do base classes



after beta:

- extract bower
- disable overwriting in MergedTree
- fix es6-concatenator API
- ? extract caching logic
- purge cache
- md5 small files



- check "file not found" errors in error page

- OK uglify
- OK filter perf
- OK avoid forwarding methods from Builder to Tree
- OK? tear down and re-set up components between builds, so that we can have the
  composition changing (picking up new bower trees)
- LATER allow components to be used in multiple places?
- OK display component timing
- OK multiple environments
- LATER source maps
- NEVER? fingerprinting
- NEVER? for trees, check if transformer.preservesMtime is true; if not, cache



- yeoman


// how to reference images (namespaced) vs assets (URLs)?
// copier (against namespaces, transforms broccoli:/ urls)
// then fingerprinter (resolves broccoli:/ urls)




- tree
  map dirs into merged src
  apply transformers
- treereader
  map trees into merged src
  apply transformers

- 1 class for both?
  .addTree
  .map
