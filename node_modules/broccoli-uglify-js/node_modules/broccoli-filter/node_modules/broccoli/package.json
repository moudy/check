  "readme": "# Broccoli\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joliss/broccoli.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joliss/broccoli)\n\nA fast, reliable asset pipeline, supporting constant-time rebuilds. Like\nSprockets, but with more modern architecture and not tied to Rails.\n\nFor the command line interface, see [broccoli-cli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-cli).\n\nFor a sample app, see [joliss/ember-app-kit#broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/ember-app-kit/tree/broccoli).\nBe sure to `npm link` (symlink) the current master branch of Broccoli into\nyour `node_modules`, as releases are infrequent and usually out-of-date.\n\n**This is pre-alpha work-in-progress. It's not usable for building actual JavaScript applications yet.**\n\nWindows is not yet supported.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save broccoli\nnpm install --global broccoli-cli\n```\n\n## Design goals\n\n* Reliable: No dodgy cache invalidation or left-over files. You should never\n  have to `rm -rf tmp` or restart the server.\n\n* Fast: Rebuilding should be O(1) and take less than 200ms.\n\n* Universal: Not just for JavaScript, but also for CSS, HTML, images, and\n  other types of assets.\n\n* Package manager integration: It should not matter whether files come from\n  your local repository or are supplied by a package manager (like bower).\n\n## Security\n\n* Currently Broccoli binds to on `0.0.0.0`, exposing your app to the world,\n  unless you use a firewall. This is what Rails does, but it still seems like\n  bad practice.\n\n* Do not run `broccoli serve` on a production server. While this is\n  theoretically safe, it exposes a needlessly large amount of attack surface\n  just for serving static assets. Instead, use `broccoli build` to precompile\n  your assets, and serve the static files from a web server of your choice.\n\n## License\n\nBroccoli was originally written by [Jo Liss](http://www.solitr.com/) and is\nlicensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n",
